# Atlassian Bamboo Plugin for AWS Tasks

A wrapper and configurator for the AWS SDK, to be used on Atlassian Bamboo for deployment tasks.

Note: Installation of the Atlassian SDK is not needed to work on or build this project. The relevant repositories have been added to this project's `pom.xml`. However, this results in a long initial download and build if you do not already have the dependencies from the SDK.

## Building

Run `mvn clean package`.

## Installation

Upload the `.obr` file from the `target` folder to your Atlassian Bamboo installation as a user-application.

## Usage

## Dependencies

- AWS Java SDK v2.0
- Atlassian Bamboo 6.8.0 (Tested as far back as 5.1.3)
